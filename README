Apache::Recorder
recorder.pl

Overview: 
The Apache::Recorder module is an implementation of a session recorder, much like a macro recorder that you might use with a GUI application.  It allows you to "record" each of the clicks that you make during an http session for later playback.  However, Apache::Recorder does not provide capabilities to "play-back" a recorded session.  To "play-back" a session, you need two additional modules: (1) HTTP::RecordedSession to "thaw" the session, and format it appropriately; and (2) A module such as HTTP::Monkeywrench which wraps testing logic around the "thawed" session.

Architecture:
1. Use recorder.pl to set a cookie.
2. Apache::Recorder will look for sessions containing a valid recorder.pl cookie.  When it finds such a session it will write information to the filesystem which can be played back at some later point.  perldoc Apache::Recorder after installation for httpd.conf instructions. 
3. Write a brief script which calls HTTP::RecordedSession to configure your session data appropriately for HTTP::Monkeywrench.  perldoc HTTP/RecordedSession after installation for a sample script.

Installation:

See INSTALL.

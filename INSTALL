Installation Summary:

1. make the package.
2. Make the appropriate changes in your mod_perl-enabled Apache httpd.conf file.  Restart Apache, if necessary.
3. Install Apache/Recorder/recorder.pl in your cgi-bin.
4. Record a session.
5. Write a script to execute HTTP::RecordedSession and HTTP::Monkeywrench with your stored session.

Installation Details:

1. make the package
Un(tar & gzip) the package Apache-Recorder-version.tar.gz into your sources directory (such as /usr/local/src).  Then:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

2. Make the appropriate changes in your mod_perl-enabled Apache httpd.conf file

To activate the Apache::Recorder handler in webroot (where webroot is /home/httpd/htdocs/) add the following lines to your httpd.conf:

    <Directory /home/httpd/htdocs>
	SetHandler perl-script
	PerlHandler Apache:Recorder:
    </Directory>

You can also chain handlers in the PerlHandler directive, like so:

PerlHandler Apache::Recorder My::Handler

3. Install Apache/Recorder/recorder.pl in your cgi-bin

copy Apache/Recorder/recorder.pl to your cgi-bin, and make sure that it has executable rights:

cp recorder.pl /home/httpd/cgi-bin/
chmod +x /home/httpd/cgi-bin/recorder.pl

4. Record a session

Point your browser to http://www.your-domain.com/cgi-bin/recorder.pl.

recorder.pl includes detailed directions.  Essentially, Apache::Recorder will be looking for a cookie -- recorder.pl lets you set this cookie, and returns the cookie id.  Jot down the cookie id so that you can use it in Step 5.

Notes:
1. If you forget to write down the cookie id, take a look at the recorder_conf_$cookie_id files in /usr/tmp and choose the correct one based on the timestamp.
2. recorder.pl sets a session cookie which will expire at the end of your current session.  Therefore, if you close down all instances of your browser after setting the cookie, you will have erased the cookie.  That's useful when you want to end the session, but not so useful if your are just about to begin it....

5. Write a script to execute HTTP::RecordedSession and HTTP::Monkeywrench with your stored session

Now that you have recorded a session, you need to pass the session to HTTP::Monkeywrench, and print the output.  Type perldoc HTTP::RecordedSession to view a sample script.

Type 'perldoc Apache::Recorder' and 'HTTP::RecordedSession' for the documentation

Requirements:
    Apache
    mod_perl
    Apache::Log
    Storable.pm
    HTTP::Monkeywrench.pm
